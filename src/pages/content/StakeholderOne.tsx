            To develop the Digital Opportunity Plan, the BDO worked with local groups and engaged
            residents across the state, reflecting Texas’ diversity. Thousands of Texans – including
            individuals from all walks of life and the diverse organizations that serve them –
            shared their experiences and informed this plan.
